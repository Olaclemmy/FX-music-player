# FX-music-player
a music player created by JavaFX, this is a course project of my java course.

Fx music player uses [JFoenix](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix) and [Undecorator](https://github.com/in-sideFX/Undecorator).

JFoenix is under Apache License 2.0, I modified some of its source codes, the modified code file is JFXScrollPane.java which is located in \src\Player\MainContent
